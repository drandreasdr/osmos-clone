Mouse movement:

## Notes
Some example repos using Piston can't be built. Solution is typically to update dependencies to the latest versions.

Switched from core piston to piston_window because I couldn't figure out how to handle mouse movement and events via piston. Also, the latter promises to be more convenient.
